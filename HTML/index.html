  <h3>"ABOUT ME"</h3>
  <p class="introduction">
    I possess a Master’s degree in Chemistry from the University of Victoria.
    More than five years of experience in a chemistry laboratory including experience
    as a Research Assistant has allowed me to be comfortable and confident within a laboratory setting.
    Through my work as laboratory chemist, I gained hands on experience and became competent in conducting
    experiments effectively. I improved my skills in following and developing protocols, producing reports,
    setting goals and implementing strategies to achieve objectives. I have also developed skills to
    communicate, discuss and collaborate with other associated groups and individuals. My experience
    as a student as well as a Teacher’s Assistant has allowed me to develop and demonstrate problem
    solving skills. Working as a Teacher’s Assistant also helped deepen my understanding of chemistry
    and helped develop my management and analytical skills.
